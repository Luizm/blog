My name is Luiz Muller I’m Brazilian and living in Joinville/SC.

I’ve been working on different projects and scopes related to DevOps culture and SRE at lest 7 years.

I have a solid knowledge of AWS, Kubernetes, Linux systems, and network (a little bit rusty), but lately, I’ve more interest in code to solve infrastructure problems.

Currently, I’m an SRE Engineer at Totvs Labs.
